# Overview

This is a modern React TypeScript component library featuring reusable UI components with comprehensive functionality, accessibility features, and design system integration. The project combines a full-stack application architecture with a sophisticated component library that includes InputField and DataTable components as the primary showcase elements.

The application serves as both a functional web app and a component documentation platform, featuring interactive Storybook documentation and comprehensive testing coverage. It's built with modern tooling including TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Radix UI primitives, and includes database integration capabilities.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety and modern React features
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling with custom design tokens and dark mode support
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessible, unstyled UI components as the foundation
- **shadcn/ui** component system integration for consistent design patterns
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing instead of React Router

## Component Library Design
- **Compound Component Pattern** used in DataTable and InputField for flexible composition
- **Controlled/Uncontrolled Pattern** support in form components for maximum flexibility
- **TypeScript Generics** extensively used in DataTable for type-safe data handling
- **CSS Variables** for theming with light/dark mode support built into the design system
- **Accessibility-first** approach with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## State Management
- **TanStack Query** (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form** for form state management with validation
- **Local Component State** using useState and useReducer for UI-specific state
- **Context API** for theme management and shared component state

## Testing Strategy
- **Vitest** as the test runner for fast, modern testing experience
- **React Testing Library** for component testing with accessibility-focused assertions
- **Storybook** for interactive component documentation and visual testing
- **TypeScript** strict mode for compile-time error prevention

## Build and Development Tools
- **ESBuild** for fast production builds and server bundling
- **PostCSS** with Autoprefixer for CSS processing
- **Path Aliases** configured for clean imports (@/, @shared/, @assets/)
- **Hot Module Replacement** in development for rapid iteration

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **Middleware Pattern** for request/response processing and error handling
- **Server-side Rendering** setup with Vite integration for development
- **Memory Storage** interface with potential for database integration

## Database Integration
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for type-safe database operations
- **PostgreSQL** dialect configured (ready for Neon Database integration)
- **Schema-first** approach with Zod validation integration
- **Migration Support** with drizzle-kit for database schema management

## Design System
- **CSS Custom Properties** for consistent theming across components
- **Responsive Design** with mobile-first approach
- **Design Tokens** for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows
- **Component Variants** using class-variance-authority for systematic styling
