git clone <repository-url>
cd react-component-library
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server:

# Frontend-only development (recommended for component library)
npx vite --config vite.config.frontend.ts

# Or full-stack development (if you need backend features)
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

This project is optimized for Vercel deployment as a frontend-only application:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`
4. Deploy with these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npx vite build --config vite.config.frontend.ts`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Manual Build

To build for production:

```bash
# Frontend-only build (for static hosting)
npx vite build --config vite.config.frontend.ts

# Full-stack build (if you need server features)
npm run build
```

The frontend build creates static files in the `dist` directory ready for deployment to any static hosting service.
